# Data Processing for Weather

A branch in [ntduoc100/demeter: It works on my machine (github.com)](https://github.com/ntduoc100/demeter), used to crawl data, preprocess, update, train and predict for a weather project.

To run this project, follow my steps:

- First run 3 files `dataCollecting.py `, `dataPreprocessing.py `and `dataUploading.py` step by step, which was specified in './github/workflows/crawlData.yml'
- Next, run `dataModelling.py` to get coefficient for model, which was used in the next phase.
- Finally, run `dataPredicting.py` to forecast weather data.
